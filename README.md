# Nasa-Rovers-App

Written in fully SwiftUI
<h4>The application displays photos taken by 3 Rover on Mars by NASA</h4>
<h5>If api key doesn’t work, create this adress <a href="url">https://api.nasa.gov/<a/><h5>
<h6>In documentation examples, the special DEMO_KEY api key is used. This API key can be used for initially exploring APIs prior to signing up, but it has much lower rate limits, so you’re encouraged to signup for your own API key if you plan to use the API (signup is quick and easy). The rate limits for the DEMO_KEY are:</h6>

<h6>
<ul>
  <li>Hourly Limit: 30 requests per IP address per hour</li>
  <li>Daily Limit: 50 requests per IP address per day</li>
</ul></h6>
